# 🧪 Completing the Haskell Plutus Tasks

Welcome to the most exciting part of your learning journey!

**Mastering Haskell and Plutus requires hands-on practice** — and that's exactly what these tasks are built for.


---

## 🗺️ Step 1: Navigate to the Task Page

Start by accessing the official task page here:

 🌐 [Haskell Practical Tasks & Progress Tracker – English](https://coxygen.co/universities-test/haskell-lessons-english.php)
 
 - Scroll to under the lesson video you will get your practical tasks questions


---

## 📚 Step 2: Understand the Tasks

Each task is carefully designed to help you:

- ✅ Grasp **Haskell fundamentals**: functional programming, pattern matching, types, etc.
- ✅ Learn **Plutus** smart contract logic (on-chain and off-chain)
- ✅ Write, test, and deploy Cardano smart contracts
- ✅ Solve real-world blockchain problems

> ⚠️ **Important**: Skipping tasks or rushing may lead to gaps in understanding, especially for advanced Plutus topics.

## 🛠️ Step 3: Completing the Tasks

To succeed in the program and gain proper verification:

1. ✅ **Start with Task 1** and follow the tasks in sequence.
2. 📖 **Read the instructions** on each task page thoroughly.
3. 🧠 **Understand the objective** of each task before starting.
4. ✍️ Complete tasks by:
   - Writing **Haskell or Plutus code**
   - Explaining theoretical ideas
   - Deploying and testing contracts (on-chain/off-chain)

## 📸 Step 4: Screenshot Every Completed Task

You are required to take a screenshot of every completed task as **proof of work**.

### 📷 Your screenshot must show:

- ✅ The **task number and title** (e.g., HC1T1)
- ✅ Your **code or written solution**
- ✅ Any **output, results, or successful test**

💾 Save each screenshot on your device.  
📂 Organize them by task, e.g.: `HC1T1.png`, `HC1T2.png`, `HC1T3.png`

> 💡 Tip: Ensure screenshots are **readable and labeled** for easier review.

## 💾 Step 5: Save Your Code Online (Optional but Recommended)

You can also save your code on the Coxygen platform:

1. Scroll to the bottom of the [Haskell Tasks Page](https://coxygen.co/universities/haskell.php)
2. Select the **Chapter** (e.g., Chapter 1)
3. Paste your **code** in the “Code” box
4. Paste your **output** in the “Output” box
5. Click **“Submit Code”**

This keeps a secure record of your progress.

---

## 🟢 Step 6: Submit Your Screenshots (Final Submission)

When you’re ready to submit screenshots:

1. Click the green submit button like `UPT1`, `UPT2`, etc.
2. You’ll be taken to a secure upload form
3. Enter your:
   - 🔐 **Passphrase**
   - 🔢 **PIN Code**
4. Click **“Choose File”** and select your saved screenshots
5. Click **“Upload File”**
6. Finally, click **“Mint Token”** to register your submission on-chain

> 🪙 **Token minting** proves your task completion and may unlock credentials or rewards!
