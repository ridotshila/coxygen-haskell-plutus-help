# 🧪 Completing the Haskell Plutus Practical Tasks

Welcome to the most exciting part of your learning journey!

**Mastering Haskell and Plutus requires hands-on practice** — and that's exactly what these tasks are built for.


---

## 🗺️ Step 1: Navigate to the Task Page

Start by accessing the official task page here:

 🌐 [Haskell Practical Tasks & Progress Tracker – English](https://coxygen.co/universities-test/haskell-lessons-english.php)
 
 - Scroll to under the lesson video you will get your practical tasks questions


---

## 📚 Step 2: Understand the Tasks

Each task is carefully designed to help you:

- ✅ Grasp **Haskell fundamentals**: functional programming, pattern matching, types, etc.
- ✅ Write, test, and deploy Cardano smart contracts
- ✅ Solve real-world blockchain problems

> ⚠️ **Important**: Skipping tasks or rushing may lead to gaps in understanding, especially for advanced Plutus topics.

---

## 🛠️ Step 3: Completing the Tasks

To succeed in the program and gain proper verification:

1. ✅ **Start with Task 1** and follow the tasks in sequence.
2. 📖 **Read the instructions** on each task page thoroughly.
3. 🧠 **Understand the objective** of each task before starting.
4. ✍️ Complete tasks by:
   - Writing **Haskell or Plutus code**
   - Explaining theoretical ideas
   - Deploying and testing contracts (on-chain/off-chain)

---

## 📸 Step 4: Screenshot Every Completed Task

You are required to take a screenshot of every completed task as **proof of work**.

### 📷 Your screenshot must show:

- ✅ The **task number and title** (e.g., HC1T1)
- ✅ Your **code or written solution**
- ✅ Any **output, results, or successful test**

💾 Save each screenshot on your device.  
📂 Organize them by task, e.g.: `HC1T1.png`, `HC1T2.png`, `HC1T3.png`

> 💡 Tip: Ensure screenshots are **readable and labeled** for easier review.

## 💾 Step 5: Save Your Code Online (✅ Mandatory Step)

You are **required** to save your code on the Coxygen platform for record-keeping, mentorship, and certification tracking.

Follow these steps:

1. 🔽 **Scroll to the bottom** of the [Haskell Tasks Page](https://coxygen.co/universities-test/haskell.php)
2. 📘 **Select the Chapter** you're working on (e.g., Chapter 1)
3. ⌨️ **Paste your code** into the **“Code”** input box
4. 🧾 **Paste the output** from running your code into the **“Output”** box
5. ✅ Click **“Submit Code”** to save it to your profile

> 🛡️ This step is **mandatory**. It ensures your progress is securely recorded and can be reviewed for feedback, verification, and token rewards.

## 🌐 Step 6: Submit Your Code to GitHub (✅ Required)
To enhance transparency, accessibility, and showcase your skills, you must also submit all your Haskell codes to your personal GitHub repository.

[📁 Follow these guidelines](github.md)

--- 

## ✅ Summary of What You Must Submit

| Task Submission Area              | Status     |
|----------------------------------|------------|
| ✔ Code on Coxygen Platform       | Mandatory  |
| ✔ Screenshots (Proof of Work)    | Mandatory  |
| ✔ Code on GitHub (MIT Licensed)  | Mandatory  |
