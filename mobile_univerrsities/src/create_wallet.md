## 🧾 Step 1: Set a Secure Passphrase

When creating the wallet, you will be asked to set a **strong passphrase** to encrypt your **private keys** and **mnemonic seed phrase**.

### ✅ Guidelines:

- Minimum **15 characters**
- Use a **mix of**:
  - Uppercase letters: `A–Z`
  - Lowercase letters: `a–z`
  - Numbers: `0–9`
  - Symbols: `!@#$%^&*()_+-={}[]|\:;"'<>,.?/~`

> ✍️ **Important**: Write your passphrase down on **paper** and store it **offline** in a safe place.  
> ❗ **Never** store it digitally or share it with anyone — anyone with this passphrase can access all your assets!

🔐 **Your passphrase (strong password - 15 characters long) is used for Cardano blockchain transaction signing**.

## 🔐 Step 2: Create a Secure PIN Code

You will also be asked to set a **PIN code** for everyday access and approval of wallet actions.

### ✅ PIN Guidelines:

- Minimum **7 digits/characters**
- Combine numbers, uppercase, lowercase, and symbols (if allowed)
- **Make it different from your passphrase!**

> 🔑 Your **PIN** is used for **app-to-wallet connection** — treat it like your bank PIN.

## ⚠️ Security Reminders

- Do **not reuse** your PIN or passphrase
- Do **not share** your mnemonic phrase (12 or 24 words) — **ever**
- Do **not screenshot or save** passwords or recovery phrases on your device or cloud
- Always **log out** after using your wallet on public or shared devices

- Receive **test tokens and credentials** for training
