# 📈 On-Chain Work Progress Traceability & Credential Minting

To ensure that your Haskell and Plutus work is securely stored, verifiable, and tamper-proof, Coxygen uses **Cardano blockchain** to **mint proof-of-work tokens**.

These tokens are **on-chain credentials** that verify your learning, participation, and task completion.
